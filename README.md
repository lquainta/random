Project: Traffic Light
Author: lquainta

About: Traffic Light detects traffic lights and plays a chime when a red light switches to green after being red for at least 5 seconds (just to
get rid of any other lights that may change while driving).

Process: Little side project to learn a little about Machine Learning and AI Delegation. I gave 2 AI chatbots a role, one was a code reviewer and 
the other was a code writer implementing feedback from the reviewer. I gave the code reviewer my original code and told it what I wanted.
Then I took that feedback and gave it to the writer to implement the feedback. I kept going back and forth just feeding the code from the
writer to the reviewer and the feedback from the reviewer to the writer until it was production ready.
